This widget allows you to inspect data traveling trough the wiring. Moreover,
you will be able to pause the events, decide if you want to drop some events and
make some modifications on those events.

Evidently, the main use of this widget is being able to debug problems in the
wiring of your widgets/operators.

See the [Application Mashup GE (Wirecloud) course at FIWARE
Lab](wirecloud-course) for more info and tutorials about how to develop.
